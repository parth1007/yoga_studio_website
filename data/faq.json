        "question": "What is the difference between doing Yoga and doing physical exercises at a Gym. Is anyone better than the other?",
        "answer": "There are certain basic differences between the two : While exercise focuses mostly on the Body, Yoga focuses equally on the Mind, Body and Soul. Exercises usually entail fast, forceful and repetitive actions whilst Yoga is all about a conscious process of stretching, bending and maintaining steadiness which has multiple benefits. Exercising builds Strength and Stamina while Yoga improves Flexibility , develops Muscle tone, enhances Peace of mind and holistic well being. Both these have their own benefits and hence knowing the above differences as well as understanding your individual long term requirements is the key to choose what you need to do."

        "question": "Are there any food / diet restrictions to be followed while doing Yoga?",
        "answer": "As per Ayurveda and Yogic literature, a Satvik diet is what is always prescribed for those who want to practice Yoga and enjoy its benefits. A Satvik diet usually includes foods and eating habits that are pure, essential, natural, energy providing, clean and fresh. It could also exemplify Ahimsa, non-violence, to Self as well as other living things and this is the reason why Yogis often follow a Vegetarian diet. A Satvik diet could include seasonal fruits, ripe vegetables, dairy products, nuts, seeds, oils, legumes, whole grains etc. Canned, cold, stale, refrigerated, preserved, impure, fermented foods and drinks etc. which are Tamasik in nature, are best avoided completely. Rajasik foods like coffee, tea, tobacco, green chillies, pepper, high quality wines etc. are also not favoured by Yogis."

        "question": "What is the best time in the day to do Yoga?",
        "answer": "The best time in the day to do Yoga is first thing in the morning before breakfast. Upon waking, empty your bowels, bathe if you wish and commence your daily regimen of Yoga. As per Vedic tradition, Brahma Muhurta, which is about 1 hour and 36 minutes before sunrise and lasting up to 48 minutes after sunrise is the perfect time for Yoga. The second best time would be evening around the time of sunset. If both these timings are not suitable then Yoga can be practised at any convenient time of the day, but on an empty stomach. It does not even matter if Yoga is practised at different times on different days as long as it fits into a routine which is regular and sustainable."

        "question": "Can I eat or consume water before doing Yoga?",
        "answer": "It is always advisable to do Yoga on an empty stomach. It is very important that the food in the stomach must be properly digested, else it will lead to uncomfortable situations during the twisting and turning, forward and backward bending postures in Yoga. Hence Yoga should be done with a gap of atleast 3 to 4 hours after a heavy meal and about 1 to 2 hours after breakfast / light meal / snacks. If you feel like eating something after doing Yoga, you should wait for at least 30 minutes as the body needs to cool down and attain normal metabolism levels. As far as drinking water is concerned, you can drink water at least 30 minutes before Yoga but ensure to empty your bladder before starting the practice. You may have a sip or two of water during the Yoga practice if really necessary."
